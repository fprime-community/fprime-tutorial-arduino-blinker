# F´ LED Blinker Tutorial for Arduino-Supported Boards

This is designed to be an extended introductory F´ tutorial taking the user through the basics of creating components, using events, telemetry, commands, and parameters, and integrating topologies with the goal of running F´ on embedded hardware. This project is an implementation of the [F´ LED Blinker ARM Linux Tutorial](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-workshop-led-blinker.git) which will allow you to test on Arduino-based microcontrollers using the [`fprime-arduino`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino.git) and [`fprime-baremetal`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-baremetal/). 

This version uses a scaled down deployment of F´ to account for the limited resources available on baremetal hardware.

> [!TIP]
> The source for this tutorial is located here: [https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-led-blinker](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-led-blinker). If you are stuck at some point during the tutorial, you may refer to that reference as the "solution".

## Prerequisites

In order to run through this tutorial, users should first do the following:

1. Meet the [F´ System Requirements](https://github.com/nasa/fprime?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirements)
2. Install an IDE or text editor supporting copy-paste. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) has [plugins](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jet-propulsion-laboratory.fpp) to work with FPP.
3. Complete the [Hello World Tutorial](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/tutorials-hello-world/docs/hello-world)
4. Acquire and set up the appropriate hardware as described in the [`Appendix: Hardware Requirements`](#appendix-hardware-requirements) for this tutorial

## 1. LED Blinker: Project Setup

> [!NOTE]
> If you have followed the [HelloWorld tutorial](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/tutorials/) previously, this should feel very familiar...

An F´ Project ties to a specific version of tools to work with F´. In order to create
this project and install the correct version of tools, you should perform a bootstrap of F´:

1. Ensure you meet the [F´ System Requirements](https://github.com/nasa/fprime?tab=readme-ov-file#system-requirements)
2. [Bootstrap your F´ project](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/docs/getting-started/installing-fprime/#creating-a-new-f-project) with the name `arduino-led-blinker`

Bootstrapping your F´ project created a folder called `arduino-led-blinker` (or any name you chose) containing the standard F´ project structure as well as the virtual environment up containing the tools to work with F´.

Navigate to your project directory and activate your virtual environment if you have not already done so:
```sh
cd arduino-led-blinker
. fprime-venv/bin/activate
```

Follow the [arduino-cli installation guide](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/main/docs/arduino-cli-install.md).

Install `fprime-arduino` dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r lib/fprime-arduino/requirements.txt
```

---

## 2. Building for Arduino Microcontrollers

This section will guide you on converting your project to build for Arduino microcontrollers using the `fprime-arduino` and `fprime-baremetal` packages.

### Adding fprime-arduino

First, add the `fprime-arduino` package as a submodule into the `lib/` directory.

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino.git lib/fprime-arduino
```

Add `fprime-arduino` as a library and change the default build toolchain to `teensy41` in `arduino-led-blinker/settings.ini` after the framework path.
```.ini
library_locations: ./lib/fprime-arduino
default_toolchain: teensy41
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to use a different board as your default toolchain, you may change `teensy41` to your desired board. The list of available boards in the `fprime-arduino` toolchain can be found [here](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/main/docs/board-list.md).

### Adding fprime-baremetal

Next, add the `fprime-baremetal` package as a submodule into your project root.

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-baremetal.git lib/fprime-baremetal
```

Add `fprime-baremetal` as an additional library alongside `fprime-arduino` into `arduino-led-blinker/settings.ini`, separated by a `:`. The complete library_locations should look like:
```.ini
library_locations: ./lib/fprime-arduino:./lib/fprime-baremetal
```

### Add Arduino Deployment

In order to produce an executable to run the software, users need to create a deployment. A deployment is one software executable that contains the main entry point, and an F´ system topology. We will be using a custom deployment that autogenerates an Arduino deployment.

First, add the line into `arduino-led-blinker/settings.ini` below the default_toolchain:
```
deployment_cookiecutter: https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter.git
```

### Generate Build Cache

Now, you are ready to generate a build cache using the following command:
```sh
fprime-util generate
```
> [!NOTE]
> Always remember to activate your project's virtual environment whenever you work with it.

## 3. LED Blinker: Component Design and Initial Implementation

The purpose of this exercise is to walk you through the creation and initial implementation of an F´ component to control the blinking of an LED. This section will discuss the design of the full component, the implementation of a command to start/stop the LED blinking, and the sending of events.  Users will then proceed to the initial ground testing before finishing the implementation in a later section.

### Component Design

In order for our component to blink an LED, it needs to accept a command to turn on the LED and drive a GPIO pin via a port call to the GPIO driver. It will also need a [rate group](https://fprime.jpl.nasa.gov/latest/documentation/user-manual/design/rate-group.md) input port to control the timing of the blink. Additionally, we will define events and telemetry channels to report component state, and a parameter to control the period of the blink.

This component design is captured in the block diagram below with input ports on the left and output ports on the right. Ports for standard F´ functions (e.g. commands, events, telemetry, and parameters) are circled in green.

![Led Component Block Diagram](img/component-design.png)

In this exercise, the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command shall toggle the blinking state of the LED. The period of the blinking is controlled by the `BLINK_INTERVAL` parameter. Blinking is implemented on the `run` rate group input port. The component also defines several telemetry channels and events describing the various actions taken by the component.

#### Design Summary

**Component Ports:**
1. `run`: invoked at a set rate from the rate group, used to control the LED blinking
2. `gpioSet`: invoked by the `Led` component to control the GPIO driver

> [!NOTE]
> Standard component ports (circled in green) are not listed here.

**Commands:**
1. `BLINKING_ON_OFF`: turn the LED blinking on/off

**Events:**
1. `InvalidBlinkArgument`: emitted when an invalid argument was supplied to the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command
2. `SetBlinkingState`: emitted when the component sets the blink state
3. `BlinkIntervalSet`: emitted when the component blink interval parameter is set
4. `LedState`: emitted when the LED is driven to a new state

**Telemetry Channels:**
1. `BlinkingState`: state of the LED blinking
2. `LedTransitions`: count of the LED transitions

**Parameters:**
1. `BLINK_INTERVAL`: LED blink period in number of rate group calls

### Create the component

It is time to create the basic component. In a terminal, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following:

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker
cd Components

fprime-util new --component
```
You will be prompted for information regarding your component. Fill out the prompts as shown below:

```bash

Generate implementation files? (yes/no) [yes]: yes
Refreshing cache and generating implementation files...
[INFO] Created new component and generated initial implementations.
```
Your new component is located in the directory `arduinio-led-blinker/Components/Led`.

#### Commands

Commands are used to command the component from the ground system or a command sequencer. We will add a command named `BLINKING_ON_OFF` to turn on or off the blinking LED. This command will take in an argument named `onOff` of type `Fw.On`.


Inside your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the file `Led.fpp` and search for the following:

```
        # One async command/port is required for active components
        # This should be overridden by the developers with a useful command/port
        @ TODO
        async command TODO opcode 0
```

Replace that block with the following:

```
        @ Command to turn on or off the blinking LED
        async command BLINKING_ON_OFF(
            onOff: Fw.On @< Indicates whether the blinking should be on or off
        )
```

#### Events

Events represent a log of system activities. Events are typically emitted any time the system takes an action. Events are also emitted to report off-nominal conditions.

Inside your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the `Led.fpp` file. After the command you added in the previous section, add this event:

```
        @ Reports the state we set to blinking.
        event SetBlinkingState($state: Fw.On) \
            severity activity high \
            format "Set blinking state to {}."
```

> [!NOTE]
> `state` is a keyword in FPP. In order to use it as a variable name, you need to escape it by prepending `$`.

#### Do it yourself

Below is a table with tasks you must complete before moving on to the next section. These tasks require you to update the component's fpp file.

| Task | Solution |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Add an activity high event named `BlinkIntervalSet` to the fpp. The event takes an argument of `U32` type to indicate the set interval. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`event BlinkIntervalSet(interval: U32) severity activity high format "LED blink interval set to {}"`</details> |
| 2. Add an activity low event named `LedState` to the fpp. The event takes an argument of `Fw.On` type to indicate the LED has been driven to a different state. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`event LedState(onOff: Fw.On) severity activity low format "LED is {}"`</details> |


You have completed the Command and Event design phase. We'll move on to the Command and Event implementation phase.

### Component Implementation

In the `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, run the following:

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util impl
```

This command will auto generate two files: `Led.template.hpp` and `Led.template.cpp`. These files contain the stub implementation for the component's newly added command.

Since this is the start of the component's implementation, we can use the generated template files for our initial component implementation. Inside your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, rename `Led.template.hpp` to `Led.hpp` and rename `Led.template.cpp` to `Led.cpp`. You can rename the files through the terminal using the two commands below:

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
mv Led.template.hpp Led.hpp
mv Led.template.cpp Led.cpp
```

Verify your component is building correctly by running the following command in the `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Fix any errors that occur before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial.

### Component State

Many of the behaviors of the component discussed in the [Component Design](#component-design) section require the tracking of some state. Before diving into the implementation of the behavior let us set up and initialize that state.

Open `Led.hpp` in `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led`, and add the following private member variables to the end of the file.

```cpp
    Fw::On m_state = Fw::On::OFF; //! Keeps track if LED is on or off
    U64 m_transitions = 0; //! The number of on/off transitions that have occurred from FSW boot up
    U32 m_toggleCounter = 0; //! Keeps track of how many ticks the LED has been on for
    bool m_blinking = false; //! Flag: if true then LED blinking will occur else no blinking will happen
```

Run the following in the `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```

Now that the member variables are set up, we can continue into the component implementation.

#### Command

Now we will implement the behavior of the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command. An initial implementation is shown below and may be copied into `Led.cpp` in-place of the BLINKING_ON_OFF command stub.

```cpp
void Led ::BLINKING_ON_OFF_cmdHandler(FwOpcodeType opCode, U32 cmdSeq, Fw::On onOff) {
    this->m_toggleCounter = 0;               // Reset count on any successful command
    this->m_blinking = Fw::On::ON == onOff;  // Update blinking state

    // TODO: Emit an event SetBlinkingState to report the blinking state (onOff).
    // NOTE: This event will be added during the "Events" exercise.

    // TODO: Report the blinking state (onOff) on channel BlinkingState.
    // NOTE: This telemetry channel will be added during the "Telemetry" exercise.

    // Provide command response
    this->cmdResponse_out(opCode, cmdSeq, Fw::CmdResponse::OK);
}
```
Run the following command in the terminal to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Fix any errors that occur before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial.

#### Events

Open `Led.cpp` in your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory and navigate to the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command. Report, via an event, the blinking state has been set.

To do so, replace:
```cpp
      // TODO: Emit an event SetBlinkingState to report the blinking state (onOff).
      // NOTE: This event will be added during the "Events" exercise.
```

with:
```cpp
    this->log_ACTIVITY_HI_SetBlinkingState(onOff);
```

Run the following to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Resolve any `fprime-util build` errors before continuing

### LED Blinker Step 3 Conclusion

Congratulations!  You have now implemented some basic functionality in a new F´ component. Your command should look like this
```cpp
void Led ::BLINKING_ON_OFF_cmdHandler(FwOpcodeType opCode, U32 cmdSeq, Fw::On onOff) {
    this->m_toggleCounter = 0;               // Reset count on any successful command
    this->m_blinking = Fw::On::ON == onOff;  // Update blinking state

    this->log_ACTIVITY_HI_SetBlinkingState(onOff);

    // TODO: Report the blinking state (onOff) on channel BlinkingState.
    // NOTE: This telemetry channel will be added during the "Telemetry" exercise.

    // Provide command response
    this->cmdResponse_out(opCode, cmdSeq, Fw::CmdResponse::OK);
}
```

Before finishing the implementation, let's take a break and try running the above command through the ground system. This will require integrating the component into the system topology, which we will get into in the next section.

> [!NOTE]
> The last TODO in the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command handler will be addressed in a future section. 

---

## 4. LED Blinker: Initial Component Integration

In this section, users will create a deployment and perform the initial integration of the LED component into that deployment. This deployment will automatically include the basic command and data handling setup needed to interact with the component. Wiring the `Led` component to the GPIO driver component will be covered in a later section after the component implementation has finished.

> [!NOTE]
> Users must have created the [initial Led component implementation](#3-led-blinker-component-design-and-initial-implementation) in order to run through this section. Users may continue to define commands, events, telemetry, and ports after this initial integration.

### Creating the `LedBlinker` Deployment

In order to produce an executable to run the software, users need to create a deployment. A deployment is one software executable that contains the main entry point, and an F´ system topology.

Create a new deployment in the `arduino-led-blinker` directory with:

```shell
# In arduino-led-blinker
fprime-util new --deployment
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must ensure that the deployment is using the arduino cookiecutter. To verify this, make sure the cookiecutter source displays references `https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter.git`. If the cookiecutter source references `builtin`, ensure you followed the [Add Arduino Deployment](#Add-Arduino-Deployment) section.

This will ask for some input, respond with the following answers:
```shell
[INFO] Cookiecutter source: https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino-deployment-cookiecutter.git
  [1/1] deployment_name (fprime-arduino-deployment): LedBlinker
[INFO] Found CMake file at 'arduino-led-blinker/project.cmake'
Add LedBlinker to arduino-led-blinker/project.cmake at end of file? (yes/no) [yes]: yes
[INFO] New deployment successfully created: /home/ethan/fprime-projects/arduino-led-blinker/LedBlinker
```
> [!NOTE]
> Use the default response for any other questions asked.

In order to check that the deployment was created successfully, the user can build the deployment. This will build the code for the current host system, not the remote embedded hardware allowing local testing during development. 

```shell
# In arduino-led-blinker
cd LedBlinker
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> This will reuse the build cache created during the project creation. CMake warnings may appear to indicate that the build cache is refreshing. The build should start shortly thereafter.

### Adding `Led` Component To The Deployment

The component can now be added to the deployment's topology effectively adding this component to the running system. This is done by modifying `instances.fpp` and `topology.fpp` in the `Top` directory.

Add the following to `arduino-led-blinker/LedBlinker/Top/instances.fpp`.  Typically, this is added to the "Active component instances" section of that document.

```
  instance led: Components.Led base id 0x0E00 \
    queue size Default.QUEUE_SIZE \
    stack size Default.STACK_SIZE \
    priority 95
```

This defines an instance of the `Led` component called `led`. Since the component is active it needs a queue size, stack size, and priority for the thread of the component and the queue that thread serves. We have chosen the topology specified defaults and a priority of 95.

Next, the topology needs to use the above definition. This is done by adding the `led` instance to the list of instances defined in `arduino-led-blinker/LedBlinker/Top/topology.fpp`:

```
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Instances used in the topology
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    instance led
```

> [!NOTE]
> No port connections need to be added because thus far the component only defines standard ports and those are connected automatically.

Build your deployment

```shell
# In arduino-led-blinker
cd LedBlinker
fprime-util build
```

### Testing the Topology

> [!NOTE]
> You may now plug in your Arduino board into your computer. Find the connected usb device by running `ls /dev/tty*`.
> 
> For Linux users, it should be along the lines of `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.
> 
> For macOS users, it should be along the lines of `/dev/cu.usbmodem12345`.
> 
> For Windows WSL2 users, you must bind your device to the WSL2 instance. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/upgrade-to-fprime-4/docs/arduino-cli-install.md#windows-wsl-2).
> 
> For Windows WSL1 users, it should be along the lines of `/dev/ttyS1`, where `S1` indicates `COM1`. Determine the COM port of your board by running `usbipd` on PowerShell or looking it up in Windows Device Manager.

First, you must upload the binary into your board. The binary is located in the `arduino-led-blinker/build-artifacts/<YOUR_TOOLCHAIN>/LedBlinker/bin/`. Refer to the upload guides in the [`board list`](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/upgrade-to-fprime-4/docs/board-list.md) to upload the correct binary to your board of choice.

Open the `fprime-gds` by running the following command:

```sh
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ../build-artifacts/teensy41/LedBlinker/dict/LedBlinkerTopologyDictionary.json --communication-selection uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200
```
This will likely open up your browser and show the running flight software.  If it does not open a browser, navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

> [!Note]
> Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` accordingly to the device port of the board.
>
> Adjust `teensy41` accordingly to your board of choice.

Test the component integration with the following steps:
1. **Verify connection**: confirm that there is a green circle and not a red X in the upper right corner.
2. **Send a Command**: select the 'Commanding' tab, search for `led.BLINKING_ON_OFF` and send it with the argument set to `ON`.
3. **Verify Event**: select the 'Events' tab and verify that the `SetBlinkingState` event reports the blinking state was set to `ON`.

`CTRL-C` to stop the F´ GDS program.

### LED Blinker Step 4 Conclusion

Congratulations! You have now integrated your component and tested that integration.

Return to the `arduino-led-blinker/LedBlinker` and run the following commands to test whenever you desire.

```sh
# In arduino-led-blinker/LedBlinker
fprime-util build
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ../build-artifacts/teensy41/LedBlinker/dict/LedBlinkerTopologyDictionary.json --communication-selection uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200

# CTRL-C to exit
```

This tutorial will return to the component implementation before finishing the integration of the component and testing on hardware.

## 5. LED Blinker: Component Design and Implementation, Continued

In this section, we will complete the component design and implementation by adding telemetry, parameters, and ports; and implementing the behavior of the `run` port, which is called by the rate-group.

> [!NOTE]
> Refer back to the [component design](#component-design) for explanations of what each of these items is intended to do.

### Continued Component Design

#### Telemetry

Telemetry channels represent the state of the system. Typically, telemetry channels are defined for any states that give crucial insight into the component's behavior.

Inside your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the `Led.fpp` file. After the events you added in the previous section, add a telemetry channel of type `Fw.On` to report the blinking state.

```
        @ Telemetry channel to report blinking state.
        telemetry BlinkingState: Fw.On
```

#### Do it yourself

Below is a table with a task you must complete before moving on to the next section. This task require you to update the component's fpp file.

| Task | Solution |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Add a telemetry channel `LedTransitions` of type `U64` to Led.fpp. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`telemetry LedTransitions: U64`</details> |

#### Parameters

Parameters are ground-controllable settings for the system. Parameters are used to set settings of the system that the ground may need to change at some point during the lifetime of the system. This tutorial sets one parameter, the blink interval.

For each parameter you define in your fpp, the F´ autocoder will autogenerate a SET and SAVE command. The SET command allows ground to update the parameter. The SAVE command tells your parameter database to stage this new parameter value for saving. To save the parameter for use on a FSW reboot, ground will need to send the `PRM_SAVE_FILE` command.

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the `Led.fpp` file. After the telemetry channels you added previously, add a parameter for the blinking interval. Give the parameter the name `BLINK_INTERVAL`, type `U32`, and a default value. It is good practice to assign parameters a valid default value.

```
        @ Blinking interval in rate group ticks
        param BLINK_INTERVAL: U32 default 1
```

#### Additional Ports

Any communication between components should be accomplished through F´ ports. Thus far we have been using a set of standard ports for handling Commands, Telemetry, Events, and Parameters. This section will add two specific ports to our component: input `run` to be called from the rate group, and output `gpioSet` to drive the GPIO driver.

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the `Led.fpp` file. After the parameters you added previously, add the following two ports:

```
        @ Port receiving calls from the rate group
        async input port run: Svc.Sched

        @ Port sending calls to the GPIO driver
        output port gpioSet: Drv.GpioWrite
```

> [!NOTE]
> Input and output ports can be given any name that you choose. In this example, we choose `run` and `gpioSet` since these names capture the behavioral intent. The types of `Svc.Sched` and `Drv.GpioWrite` are significant as these types must match the remote component.

### Continued Component Implementation

#### Input Port Implementation

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, run the following to autogenerate stub functions for the `run` input port we just added.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util impl
```

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open `Led.template.hpp` file and copy this block over to `Led.hpp`.

```cpp
  PRIVATE:
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    // Handler implementations for user-defined typed input ports
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    //! Handler implementation for run
    //!
    //! Port receiving calls from the rate group
    void run_handler(FwIndexType portNum,  //!< The port number
                     U32 context  //!< The call order
                     ) override;
```

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open `Led.template.cpp` file and copy this block over to `Led.cpp`.
```cpp
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------
// Handler implementations for user-defined typed input ports
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------

void Led ::run_handler(FwIndexType portNum, U32 context) {
    // TODO
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Copying from the template file and pasting into your implementation file is a pattern in F Prime that is often used when adding new input ports or commands.

The `run` port will be invoked repeatedly on each cycle of the rate group. Each invocation will call into the `run_handler` function such that the component may perform behavior on each cycle.

Here we want to turn the LED on or OFF based on a cycle count to implement the "blinking" behavior we desire.

Copy the run_handler implementation below into your run_handler. Try filling in the TODOs based on what you learned and defined in previous sections.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to read the code and comments to understand more about how to use F´.

```cpp
void Led ::run_handler(FwIndexType portNum, U32 context) {
    // Read back the parameter value
    Fw::ParamValid isValid = Fw::ParamValid::INVALID;
    U32 interval = this->paramGet_BLINK_INTERVAL(isValid);
    FW_ASSERT((isValid != Fw::ParamValid::INVALID) && (isValid != Fw::ParamValid::UNINIT),
              static_cast<FwAssertArgType>(isValid));

    // Only perform actions when set to blinking
    if (this->m_blinking && (interval != 0)) {
        // If toggling state
        if (this->m_toggleCounter == 0) {
            // Toggle state
            this->m_state = (this->m_state == Fw::On::ON) ? Fw::On::OFF : Fw::On::ON;
            this->m_transitions++;
            // TODO: Report the number of LED transitions (this->m_transitions) on channel LedTransitions

            // Port may not be connected, so check before sending output
            if (this->isConnected_gpioSet_OutputPort(0)) {
                this->gpioSet_out(0, (Fw::On::ON == this->m_state) ? Fw::Logic::HIGH : Fw::Logic::LOW);
            }

            // TODO: Emit an event LedState to report the LED state (this->m_state).
        }

        this->m_toggleCounter = (this->m_toggleCounter + 1) % interval;
    }
    // We are not blinking
    else {
        if (this->m_state == Fw::On::ON) {
            // Port may not be connected, so check before sending output
            if (this->isConnected_gpioSet_OutputPort(0)) {
                this->gpioSet_out(0, Fw::Logic::LOW);
            }

            this->m_state = Fw::On::OFF;
            // TODO: Emit an event LedState to report the LED state (this->m_state).
        }
    }
}
```
In the terminal, run the following to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Fix any errors that occur before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial.

#### Command Implementation Continued

Inside your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open `Led.cpp`, and navigate to the `BLINKING_ON_OFF` command. Report the blinking state via the telemetry channel we just added. To do so, replace the following:

```cpp
      // TODO: Report the blinking state (onOff) on channel BlinkingState.
      // NOTE: This telemetry channel will be added during the "Telemetry" exercise.
```

with the function to send the telemetry channel:

```cpp
    this->tlmWrite_BlinkingState(onOff);
```

In the terminal, run the following to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```

> [!NOTE]
> Fix any errors that occur before proceeding with the rest of the tutorial.

#### Parameter Implementation

When ground updates a component's parameter, the user may want the component to react to the parameter update. F Prime provides a function called `parameterUpdated` where your component can react to each parameter update. Implementing `parameterUpdated` for a component is optional but we'll implement it for this tutorial.

In your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open the file `Led.hpp` and add the following function signature in the `PRIVATE:` scope:

```cpp
    //! Emit parameter updated EVR
    //!
    void parameterUpdated(FwPrmIdType id  //!< The parameter ID
                          ) override;
```

> This function is called when a parameter is updated via the auto generated SET command. Although the value is updated automatically, this function gives developers a chance to respond to changing parameters. This tutorial uses it to emit an event.

Save file and in your `arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led` directory, open `Led.cpp` and add the implementation for `parameterUpdated`:

```cpp
void Led ::parameterUpdated(FwPrmIdType id) {
    Fw::ParamValid isValid = Fw::ParamValid::INVALID;
    switch (id) {
        case PARAMID_BLINK_INTERVAL: {
            // Read back the parameter value
            const U32 interval = this->paramGet_BLINK_INTERVAL(isValid);
            // NOTE: isValid is always VALID in parameterUpdated as it was just properly set
            FW_ASSERT(isValid == Fw::ParamValid::VALID, static_cast<FwAssertArgType>(isValid));

            // Emit the blink interval set event
            // TODO: Emit an event with, severity activity high, named BlinkIntervalSet that takes in an argument of
            // type U32 to report the blink interval.
            break;
        }
        default:
            FW_ASSERT(0, static_cast<FwAssertArgType>(id));
            break;
    }
}
```

In the terminal, run the following to verify your component is building correctly.

```bash
# In arduino-led-blinker/Components/Led
fprime-util build
```
> [!NOTE]
> Resolve any errors before continuing

### Do it Yourself

Below is a table with tasks you must complete. These tasks require you to go back into the component's code and add the missing function calls.

| Task | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Inside the `parameterUpdated` function, emit an activity high event named `BlinkIntervalSet` that takes in an argument of type `U32` to report the blink interval. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`this->log_ACTIVITY_HI_BlinkIntervalSet(interval);`</details> |
| Inside the `run_handler` port handler, report the number of LED transitions (this->m_transitions) on channel LedTransitions. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`this->tlmWrite_LedTransitions(this->m_transitions);`</details> |
| Inside the `run_handler` port handler, emit an event LedState to report the LED state (this->m_state). There are two places to add this event. | <details><summary>Answer</summary>`this->log_ACTIVITY_LO_LedState(this->m_state);`</details> |

> [!TIP]
> Emitting an event follows this pattern: `this->log_<severity>_<eventName>(<argument_if_any>);`  
> [!TIP]
> Emitting a telemetry channel follows this pattern: `this->tlmWrite_<telemetryChannel>(<telemetryValue>);`
> [!TIP]
> After running `fprime-util build`, your IDE should be able to autocomplete these functions.


### LED Blinker Step 5 Conclusion

Congratulations! You just completed the implementation of your component. It is time for full system integration!

## 6. LED Blinker: Full System Integration

Now it is time to add a GPIO driver to our system and attach it to the `led` component instance. We'll also connect the `led` component instance to a 1 Hz rate group. Finally, we'll configure the driver to manage the GPIO `LED_BUILTIN` pin on our hardware. Once this section is finished, the system is ready for running on hardware.

### Adding the GPIO Driver to the Topology

`fprime-arduino` provides a GPIO driver for Arduino microcontrollers called `Arduino.GpioDriver`. This should be added to both the instance definition list and the topology instance list just like we did for the `led` component. Since the GPIO driver is a passive component, its definition is a bit more simple.

Add to "Passive Component" section of `led-blinker/LedBLinker/Top/instance.fpp`:
```
    instance gpioDriver: Arduino.GpioDriver base id 0x5000
```

Add to the instance list of `led-blinker/LedBlinker/Top/topology.fpp`:
```
    instance gpioDriver
```

> [!NOTE]
> In `led-blinker/LedBlinker` build the deployment and resolve any errors before continuing.

### Wiring The `led` Component Instance to the `gpioComponent` Component Instance and Rate Group

The `Led` component defines the `gpioSet` output port and the `Arduino.GpioDriver` defines the `gpioWrite` input port. These two ports need to be connected from output to input. The `ActiveRateGroup` component defines an array of ports called `RateGroupMemberOut` and one of these needs to be connected to `run` port defined on the `Led` component.

We can create a named connections block in the topology and connect the two port pairs. Remember to use the component instances and not the component definitions for each connection.

To do this, add the following lines to `led-blinker/LedBLinker/Top/topology.fpp`:
```
    # Named connection group
    connections LedConnections {
      # Rate Group 1 (1Hz cycle) ouput is connected to led's run input
      rateGroup1.RateGroupMemberOut[3] -> led.run
      # led's gpioSet output is connected to gpioDriver's gpioWrite input
      led.gpioSet -> gpioDriver.gpioWrite
    }
```

> [!NOTE]
> `rateGroup1` is preconfigured to call all `RateGroupMemberOut` at a rate of 1 Hz. We use index `RateGroupMemberOut[3]` because `RateGroupMemberOut[0]` through `RateGroupMemberOut[2]` were used previously in the `RateGroups` connection block.

### Configuring The GPIO Driver

So far the GPIO driver has been instantiated and wired, but has not been told what GPIO pin to control. For this tutorial, the built-in LED will be used. To configure this, the `open` function needs to be called in the topology's C++ implementation and passed the pin's number and direction.

This is done by adding the following line to the end of the `configureTopology` function defined in `led-blinker/LedBLinker/Top/LedBLinkerTopology.cpp`.

```
void configureTopology() {
    gpioDriver.open(Arduino::DEF_LED_BUILTIN, Arduino::GpioDriver::GpioDirection::OUT);
}
```

This code tells the GPIO driver to open pin `LED_BUILTIN` (usually pin 13) as an output pin. If your device does not have a built in LED, select a GPIO pin of your choice.

> [!NOTE]
> In `led-blinker/LedBlinker` build the deployment and resolve any errors before continuing.

### LED Blinker Step 6 Conclusion

Congratulations!  You've wired your component to the rate group driver and GPIO driver components. It is time to try it on your hardware.

## 7. LED Blinker: Running on Hardware

Now it is time to run on hardware. Ensure the microcontroller is connected to the host machine via USB.

First, upload the binary file to the board after building. Reference the [board list](https://github.com/fprime-community/fprime-arduino/blob/main/docs/board-list.md) for guidance on uploading the binaries for your board.

Next run the F´ GDS without launching the native compilation (`-n`) and with the dictionary from the build above (`--dictionary ./build-artifacts/teensy41/LedBlinkerTopologyDictionary.json`). Connect it to the USB device by adding the `--communication-selection`, `--uart-device`, and `--uart-baud` flags

```sh
# In the project root
fprime-gds -n --dictionary ./build-artifacts/teensy41/LedBlinker/dict/LedBlinkerTopologyAppDictionary.xml --communication-selection uart --uart-device /dev/ttyACM0 --uart-baud 115200
```

> [!Note]
> Adjust `/dev/ttyACM0` accordingly to the device port of the board.
>
> Adjust `teensy41` accordingly to your board of choice.

For MacOS users, you may have to install `pyserial`: `pip install pyserial`

You should be able to view the GDS on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/). The green circle should now appear on the top right of F´ GDS.

### Testing the Topology

Test the component integration with the following steps:

1. Verify connection: confirm that there is a green circle and not a red X in the upper right corner.
2. Send a Command: select the 'Commanding' tab, search for led.BLINKING_ON_OFF and send it with the argument set to ON.
3. Verify Event: select the 'Events' tab and verify that the SetBlinkingState event reports the blinking state was set to ON.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to turn the LED OFF.
5. Verify Telemetry: select the 'Channels' tab and verify that the LedBlinker telemetries appear.

### LED Blinker Step 7 Conclusion

Congratulations you've now run on hardware. The final section of this tutorial is to test the component via some system tests!

## Appendix: Hardware Requirements

Users will need at least one hardware element to follow the LED Blinker tutorial: an embedded Arduino-based microcontroller with an on-board LED. If there is no on-board LED, you will need an external LED capable of withstanding the operating voltage.

### Arduino Microcontroller Requirements

The microcontroller must have sufficient FLASH memory and SRAM to run F´. The current requirements are at least 140 KB of FLASH memory and 30 KB of RAM.

### Wiring Diagram

For this tutorial, the on-board LED pin will be used (LED_BUILTIN). For most Arduino microcontrollers, this is GPIO pin 13. For platforms that do not have an on-board LED pin readily available, another pin should be chosen, noted, and used in-place of LED_BUILTIN (13).
